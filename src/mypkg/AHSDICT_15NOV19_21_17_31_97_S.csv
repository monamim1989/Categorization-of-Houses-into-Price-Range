The Noninterview Adjustment Factor increases the weight of each interviewed unit to account for sampled units that were not interviewed. This adjustment is applied to five classes of geography: central cities, urban and rural inside MSAs, urban and rural outside MSAs. Over time the geographic boundaries related to these five classes may be redefined by local or state governments.

Levels of topcoding and topcode values may vary for people within households. The person-level variables were also topcoded by the supplemental metropolitan areas and the remainder of the cases. In surveys prior to 2005, the Census Bureau's practice was that if a household listed no sources of nonlabor income, VOTHER was coded as blank, not zero. Similarly, if a person had no labor income, SAL was coded as blank. Beginning in 2005, these became zero values instead. VOTHER can take negative values legitimately. HUD used the SAS version of the PUF to produce a CSV (ASCII) version. The conversion process gives missing value interpretations to the range -9 to -6. In order to avoid ambiguities in the few cases in which VOTHER has a value of -5 to -9, these values are recoded to -4. Users of the CSV version should be aware that this occurs in a small number of cases. Prior to 2009, the minimum recorded value was -$10,000.
